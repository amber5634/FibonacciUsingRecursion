# FibonacciUsingRecursion
In this simple yet powerful program we are going to calculate the Fibonacci of a Number using Recursion.
Knowing about the exponential cost.
Running the program for Fibonacci of 20 may not be a problem or Running this program for small numbers then you will be able to see the output in the terminal.

However if you go for large numbers like let say 80 which means calculating the Fibonacci of F(80) then suppose if you are in your 1st year graduation then even at the end of your graduation year this program will not run because of exponential overhead.

If you want to reduce the exponential overhead/cost the we will be using the Memoization approach. A modern and better powerful programming paradigm.


In Memoization we will be remembering the functional call and using it when required with the help of arrays.


I have attached both programs in java.

Please have a look.
